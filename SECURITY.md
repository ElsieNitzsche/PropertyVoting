## Security Measures

### Smart Contract Security

1. **Access Controls**
   - Role-based permissions
   - Property manager authorization
   - Resident registration validation

2. **Input Validation**
   - Unit number range checks (1-200)
   - Vote choice validation (0 or 1)
   - Duration limits (24-168 hours)
   - Address zero checks

3. **State Management**
   - Duplicate registration prevention
   - Double voting prevention
   - Proposal lifecycle enforcement
   - Time-based access control

4. **Encryption**
   - FHE encryption for sensitive data
   - Vote privacy preservation
   - Encrypted unit numbers

### Development Security

1. **Code Quality**
   - Solhint linting
   - Prettier formatting
   - TypeScript type checking
   - Comprehensive test coverage (53+ tests)

2. **Automated Security Scanning**
   - Slither static analysis
   - Mythril symbolic execution
   - npm audit for dependencies
   - TruffleHog secret scanning

3. **CI/CD Security**
   - Automated security audits
   - Dependency vulnerability checks
   - Contract size verification
   - Gas cost monitoring

### Deployment Security

1. **Pre-Deployment Checklist**
   - All tests passing
   - Security audit completed
   - Gas costs optimized
   - Contract verified on Etherscan
   - No hardcoded secrets

2. **Environment Security**
   - Private keys in secure storage
   - Environment variables properly configured
   - RPC endpoints secured
   - API keys protected

3. **Network Security**

## Known Security Considerations

### FHE Operations

**Consideration:** Fully Homomorphic Encryption operations have higher gas costs.

**Mitigation:**
- Gas optimization in contract design
- Efficient data structures
- Batch operations where possible
- Clear gas cost documentation

### Time-Based Logic

**Consideration:** Block timestamp manipulation by miners.

**Mitigation:**
- Reasonable time windows (hours, not seconds)
- Buffer periods for critical operations
- Time-lock mechanisms

### Decryption Dependencies

**Consideration:** Results revelation depends on KMS (Key Management System).

**Mitigation:**
- Multiple pauser addresses for redundancy
- Gateway contract fallback mechanisms
- Timeout handling
- Event logging for transparency

### Frontend Security

**Consideration:** Web3 wallet interactions and user data.

**Mitigation:**
- Input sanitization
- CORS configuration
- Secure connection requirements (HTTPS)
- User transaction confirmation prompts

## Security Best Practices for Users

### For Property Managers

1. **Private Key Security**
   - Use hardware wallets for mainnet
   - Never share private keys
   - Store backups securely offline
   - Consider multi-signature wallets

2. **Transaction Verification**
   - Review all transaction details before signing
   - Verify contract addresses
   - Check gas costs
   - Confirm recipient addresses

3. **Access Control**
   - Rotate keys periodically
   - Limit access to authorized personnel
   - Monitor contract events
   - Audit transaction history

### For Residents

1. **Wallet Security**
   - Use reputable wallet providers
   - Enable 2FA where available
   - Keep software updated
   - Beware of phishing attacks

2. **Privacy Protection**
   - Understand vote encryption
   - Verify contract addresses
   - Check network (Sepolia testnet)
   - Don't share sensitive information

3. **Transaction Safety**
   - Confirm transaction details
   - Verify gas costs are reasonable
   - Check proposal information
   - Report suspicious activity
