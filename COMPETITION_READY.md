## Future Enhancement Roadmap

### Immediate (Post-Competition)
1. Increase test coverage to 95%+
2. Add frontend testing suite
3. Security audit integration
4. Performance optimization

### Short-term (1-3 months)
1. Multi-language UI support
2. Mobile responsive improvements
3. Advanced analytics dashboard
4. Real-time vote monitoring

### Long-term (3-6 months)
1. Multi-chain deployment
2. DAO governance integration
3. Mobile application
4. Property management system integration

---

## Known Limitations

### Current Limitations
1. **Testnet Only**: Currently deployed on Sepolia (mainnet requires production review)
2. **Single Proposal at a Time**: Cannot create new proposal while one is active
3. **No Vote Modification**: Once cast, votes cannot be changed
4. **KMS Dependency**: Results revelation requires external KMS service

### Mitigation Strategies
1. Testnet is appropriate for demonstration and testing
2. Sequential proposals ensure focused decision-making
3. No vote modification preserves integrity
4. KMS dependency is fhEVM architectural requirement

**None of these are competition blockers** - they are design choices or platform requirements.
