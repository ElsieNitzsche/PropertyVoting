## Development Workflow

### Branch Strategy

- `main` - Production-ready code
- `develop` - Integration branch for features
- `feature/*` - New features
- `bugfix/*` - Bug fixes
- `hotfix/*` - Urgent fixes for production

### Creating a Branch

```bash
# For a new feature
git checkout -b feature/add-voting-delegation

# For a bug fix
git checkout -b bugfix/fix-registration-error

# For documentation
git checkout -b docs/update-readme
```

### Making Changes

1. **Write clean, documented code**
2. **Follow coding standards** (see below)
3. **Add tests** for new functionality
4. **Update documentation** as needed
5. **Run linters and formatters**

```bash
# Format code
npm run format

# Lint code
npm run lint

# Run tests
npm test

# Run security checks
npm run test:security

# Run performance tests
npm run test:performance
```

## Coding Standards

### Solidity Standards

**Style Guide:**
- Follow [Solidity Style Guide](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/style-guide.html)
- Use descriptive variable and function names
- Add NatSpec comments for all public functions

**Example:**
```solidity
/**
 * @notice Registers a resident with their unit number
 * @param unitNumber The residential unit number (1-200)
 * @dev Unit number must be unique and within valid range
 */
function registerResident(uint256 unitNumber) external {
    require(unitNumber > 0 && unitNumber <= 200, "Invalid unit number");
    require(!residents[msg.sender].isRegistered, "Already registered");

    // Implementation
}
```

**Best Practices:**
- Minimize gas costs
- Use events for important state changes
- Implement proper access controls
- Validate all inputs
- Handle edge cases

### JavaScript/TypeScript Standards

**Style:**
- Use ES6+ syntax
- Prefer `const` over `let`, avoid `var`
- Use async/await over callbacks
- Add JSDoc comments for functions

**Example:**
```javascript
/**
 * Deploy voting contract to network
 * @param {string} gatewayAddress - Gateway contract address
 * @returns {Promise<Contract>} Deployed contract instance
 */
async function deployVotingContract(gatewayAddress) {
    const VotingContract = await ethers.getContractFactory("AnonymousPropertyVoting");
    const contract = await VotingContract.deploy(gatewayAddress);
    await contract.deployed();
    return contract;
}
```

### Formatting

**Automated formatting:**
```bash
# Format all files
npm run format

# Check formatting
npx prettier --check 'contracts/**/*.sol' 'scripts/**/*.js' 'test/**/*.js'
```

**Manual guidelines:**
- Indentation: 2 spaces for JS, 4 spaces for Solidity
- Line length: Max 120 characters
- Trailing commas: Yes (where valid)
- Semicolons: Required in JS
- Quotes: Double quotes for Solidity, single for JS

---

## Testing Guidelines

### Test Coverage Requirements

All contributions must include tests:

- **New features**: 100% test coverage
- **Bug fixes**: Test demonstrating the bug + fix
- **Refactoring**: Maintain existing coverage

### Writing Tests

**Structure:**
```javascript
describe("Feature Name", function () {
    beforeEach(async function () {
        // Setup
    });

    it("Should perform specific action", async function () {
        // Arrange
        const expectedValue = 123;

        // Act
        const actualValue = await contract.someFunction();

        // Assert
        expect(actualValue).to.equal(expectedValue);
    });
});
```

**Best Practices:**
- Use descriptive test names starting with "Should..."
- Test both success and failure cases
- Test edge cases and boundaries
- Use fixtures for complex setups
- Keep tests independent

### Running Tests

```bash
# All tests
npm test

# Specific test file
npx hardhat test test/AnonymousPropertyVoting.test.js

# With coverage
npm run test:coverage

# With gas reporting
npm run test:gas

# Performance tests
npm run test:performance
```

## Security Guidelines

### Security Review Checklist

Before submitting code:

- [ ] No hardcoded private keys or secrets
- [ ] Input validation on all external functions
- [ ] Proper access controls implemented
- [ ] Re-entrancy protection where needed
- [ ] Integer overflow/underflow prevention
- [ ] Events emitted for state changes
- [ ] Gas optimization considered
- [ ] Security audit tools run

### Running Security Tools

```bash
# Solhint linting
npm run lint

- **Profile performance** with benchmarks

```bash
# Run performance benchmarks
npm run performance:benchmark

# Run load tests
npm run performance:load
```
